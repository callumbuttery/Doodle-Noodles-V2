                        Our Golden Rune system allows
                        5 lucky minters to have a
                        customer Doodle Noodle created
                        and minted for them to their
                        own specifications yb our artists

                        Every Doodle Noodle will have
                        an associated rune, which will
                        be used in future for
                        competitions and giveaways.
                        But if you mint and find a
                        Golden Rune on your NFT - you
                        should start thinking about
                        what your ideal Doodle Noodle
                        would look like!
