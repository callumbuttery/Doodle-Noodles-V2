                5 lucky minters to have a
                customer Doodle Noodle created
                and minted for them to their
                own specifications yb our artists
                Grin!

                Every Doodle Noodle will have
                an associated rune, which will
                be used in future for
                competitions and giveaways.

                Golden Rune on your NFT - you
                should start thinking about
                what your ideal Doodle Noodle
                would look like!
